HQ,"HQ stands for headquarters unit. A headquarters unit might be a heroic commander or fearsome monster. These models are amongst the most powerful in the game, and as leaders, they have access to more special equipment than anyone else. They are not invincible, but can provide a powerful spearhead for an attacking army and a strong core for a defensive one.",media/HQ.png
Troops,"These represent the most commonly available soldiers in an army. This does not mean they are poor fighters – the category includes such troops as Chaos Space Marines and Ork Boyz, both formidable adversaries. Typically, these are the warriors that make up the bulk of an army. Their main tactical role is that of consolidating the gains of the army and defending the objectives that have been taken by more specialised units. ",media/Troops.png
Elites,"Elite units are normally powerful but expensive. They are the best, and often most specialised, soldiers an army has to offer, but there are rarely ever enough of them. In some cases they will be specialists, while at other times they will be more experienced versions of regular soldiers.",media/Elites.png
Fast Attack,"Fast Attack units are generally faster than their comrades, and are masters of manoeuvrability. Often, they are used for reconnaissance and scouting, while at other times they are ferocious assault troops who rely on speed to get their bloody work done.",media/Fast Attack.png
Heavy Support,"Heavy Support units are literally the big guns of the army and include the heaviest items of equipment and the toughest creatures. However, they are also very expensive in points, so an over-reliance on them might leave you badly outnumbered.",media/Heavy Support.png
Fortification,"Fortifications are battlefield defences, including everything from barricades to towering fortresses. They are typically buildings and/or battlefield debris that your army has either constructed or captured just before the start of the battle. You’ll find a wide range of fortifications presented in Warhammer 40,000: Stronghold Assault, and further fortification datasheets feature in other Games Workshop publications.",media/Fortification.png
Lords of War,"Lords of War are the most powerful and destructive units to wage war in the 41st Millennium. They include towering monstrosities and super-heavy vehicles that bristle with enough weaponry to lay waste to anything foolish enough to stand before them. You’ll find a selection of Lords of War units in some codexes and in Warhammer 40,000: Escalation.",media/Lords of War.png
